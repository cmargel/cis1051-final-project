# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

2048 game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will be a version of the popular game 2048.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will stimulate a full game of 2048. It will be a game where you combine tiles with the same number to get to 2048. New tiles will appear after every turn. If there are no tiles left to combine, you lose but if you get a single tile to sum 2048, you win. The game will allow a user to combine tiles to get to a sum of 2048 or end the game if no more tiles can be combined. Users will use letter keys on the keyboard to swipe the board up, down, right, or left. After each turn, the game board will update and print an updated version of the game board. It will have a graphic user interface, which we will use Pygame to create.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Sydney Kimbell, tum99567@temple.edu, Joanne

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have the game board update, print, and allow users to move around tiles and the values on those tiles add together. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a better outcome, the 2048 game will look visually appealing and will be able to detect when the user has lost or won.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to be able to have a fully functional game of 2048 that users can play using keys on the keyboard and that will have a visually appealing graphic user interface and display a message when the user wins or losses.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to familiarize myself with Pygame and how to import and use those tools. My teammates and I will need to look into how to make a matrix, for the game board, and how the code would look when tiles are "combined". We will also need to do some research to learn how to use Pygame and incorporate that into the logic of the game. I will look into how to go about using Pygame and Sydney and Jo will begin the logic of the game and start coding that.

# Final Reflection
## Problems
We had some issues getting the GUI to work while using Pygame. It took a lot of time and research to learn how to use Pygame and all of the properties that were unique to it. The hardest part was being able to initially get the screen to show up with the right things on it and not just be black. Once we figured out how to properly install Pygame and get the initial screen to show up, we had gotten past the hard part.
We also have an issue with the game closing when the user wins or loses. No message shows up to let the user know if they won or lost. This relates to the issues we have interpreting how Pygame works.
## Take Aways
I learned a lot while completing this project. I have not working with functions nearly as much before this project and had to learn how to best optimize each function. It took a lot of testing to figure out what inputs each function needed to have and what each function needed to return. This project also helped me learn to keep my functions as short and concise as possible. I learned that each function should ideally have one specific purpose.
## What I Enjoyed
I enjoyed being able to code something fun. The 2048 game is something I've enjoyed playing on my phone and it was enjoyable trying to reacreate and really understand the logic behind it. I found it interesting to look at a game from a new persepctive and break down how exactly it works.
