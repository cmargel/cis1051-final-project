# cis1051-final-project
# Preproposal
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
2048 game or magic mirror using raspberry pi
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Joann Chandra and Sydney Kimbell
## Do you have any questions of your own?
Not as of right now

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

2048 game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project will be a version of the popular game 2048.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will stimulate a full game of 2048. It will be a game where you combine tiles with the same number to get to 2048. New tiles will appear when two are combined. If there are no tiles left to combine, you lose but if you get a tile to sum 2048, you win. It will allow a user to combine tiles to get to a sum of 2048 or end the game if no more tiles can be combined. It will have a graphic user interface, which we will use Pygame to create.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Sydney Kimbell, tum99567@temple.edu, Joanne
Joann Zambito, tun41629@temple.edu, Shi

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be to have the game board and allow users to move around tiles. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think that we can create a game board that will allow users to combine tiles and the values on those tiles would add together. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to be able to have a complete game of 2048 that users can play using the arrows on the keyboard and that will have a visually appealing graphic user interface.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to familiarize myself with Pygame and how to import and use those tools. My teammates and I will need to look into how to make a matrix, for the game board, and how the code would look when tiles are "combined". We will also need to do some research to learn how to use Pygame and incorporate that into the logic of the game. I will look into how to go about using Pygame and Sydney and Jo will begin the logic of the game and start coding that.
